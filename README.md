# Probabilistic-Topic-Models-Based-Music-Recommendation-System
Pattern Recognition course project

•	Iimplemented LDA and HDP probabilistic topic models (in python) on music dataset

•	Implemented Kullback-Leibler divergence to compute the similarity of music-topic distribution we got from 2 probabilistic topic models. 

•	Made music recommendations based on KL and compared performance of 2 models.
